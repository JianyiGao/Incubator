            <h4> This is where it all begins. During Orientation,
              we will review the Founder Institute program structure,
              curriculum, tools, and requirements. You will review
              why you have pursued entrepreneurship, and how you or your
              team will use the program to push your business or business
               idea forward.</h4>
            <h2>Assignments</h2>
            <p>During Orientation, Founders and teams will be segmented into the
             “Standard Founder” or “Advanced Founder” assignment tracks,
            depending on the stage of their business or business idea.</p>
            <p>These assignments are in addition to any custom "Special
               Assignments" Founders receive based on their specific challenges,
              and below is a small sample of the assignments you’ll complete
              through Working Groups and Office Hours:</p>
            <h3>Standard Founder Assignments</h3>

               <p><b>Progress</b> -
                 If you have started working on one or more ideas before the program,
                  outline each of your ideas and any testing or progress made to date.</p>
               <p><b>Hotseat Pitch</b> - Prepare a one minute verbal pitch for the weekly
                 “Founder Hotseat”, where you present to Mentors during the sessions.
                 Start with our one-sentence pitch template, and if you do not have a
                 final idea yet, describe yourself and a field that you are passionate
                 about and uniquely qualified to build a business around.</p>
               <p><b>Co-Founders</b> - If you are looking for a Co-founder, create a basic
                 description of what you are looking for, and this will be shared with
                 the rest of your cohort.</p>
            <h3>Advanced Founder Assignments</h3>

               <p><b>Program Goals</b> - Outline the monthly objectives you or your team
                 want to achieve with your business while participating in Founder
                 Institute, including the specific support you feel that we can give
                 you to succeed beyond the curriculum.</p>
               <p><b>Key Performance Indicators</b> - Outline the specific metrics or key
                  performance indicators (KPIs) that you are currently using to track
                   success. Analyze the validity of these metrics, and create a plan
                  to share updated metrics and progress with your Directors every
                  week in the program.</p>
               <p><b>Hotseat Pitch</b> - Prepare a one minute verbal pitch for the weekly
                  “Founder Hotseat”, where you present to Mentors during the sessions.
                   Start with our one-sentence pitch template, followed by why you
                   are uniquely qualified to pursue the idea, and any progress that
                  you’ve made to date.</p>
