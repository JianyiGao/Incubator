# Dependencies
### For whatever reason, I had to run the following as root (not sudo):
 ```
 sudo apt-get install npm
 ```

# Run
  ```
  cd meanjs
  sudo npm install
  bower install
  npm start
  (alternative: gulp //Use gulp instead of npm start to prevent bash not responding if website crash)
  ```

# Current Modules
- Articles (Demo)
- Calendar (Open source, to be replaced with Google Calendar)
- Chat (Demo)
- Core
- Users (Demo)
